\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
% This does not have to be long, but try to write a few reasonable closing remarks.

% Quickly say what we have implemented and what results we got.

% Say how looking at errors and especially NIS and NEES was extensively used in all parts - shows the greatness of consistency analysis

% write some inspiring shit about how all this is applications of the almighty kalman filter. Especially how the trick with letting control input be a measurement is used in both ESKF and EKFSLAM.
