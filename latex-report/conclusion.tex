\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this report, several methods from the course TTK4250 - Sensor Fusion, and the results from applying them to different data sets, have been stated and discussed. The methods implemented were the tracking method \acrshort{imm_pdaf}, the inertial navigation method \acrshort{eskf} and the \acrshort{slam} method \acrshort{ekf_slam}. These methods have been tuned to give good results as well as consistency. By analysing the \acrshort{nis} and \acrshort{nees} where possible, 

% This does not have to be long, but try to write a few reasonable closing remarks.

% Quickly say what we have implemented and what results we got.

% Say how looking at errors and especially NIS and NEES was extensively used in all parts - shows the greatness of consistency analysis

% write some inspiring shit about how all this is applications of the almighty kalman filter. Especially how the trick with letting control input be a measurement is used in both ESKF and EKFSLAM.
