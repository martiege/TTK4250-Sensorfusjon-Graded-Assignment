\section{Graded Assignment 3}\label{sec:graded_assignment_3}

% A full answer and result analysis is expected for task 3 and 4. For task 3 you should include a plot of the pose over time as well as the final estimated landmarks for your choice of parameters, in addition to NEES and NIS over time for the same set of parameters. In task 4 the same plots are expected, where the GPS can be used for ground truth. For both tasks it should be made clear why the parameters were chosen in terms of error metrics, consistency and overall result. Answers and analysis should connect theory and results to the real world, and show your understanding for the problem and solution. Try to connect the results on the simulated data to the results of the read data where and if it is possible.
